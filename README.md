Spotify Quicksilver Plugin
==========================

Support 9 different commands to control Spotify.

Commands include:

* Dcrease Volume (Spotify)

* Increase Volume (Spotify)

* Mute (Spotify)

* Next Song (Spotify)

* Previous Song (Spotify)

* Play (Spotify)

* Pause (Spotify)

* Play/Pause (Spotify)

* Share on Twitter (Spotify)*

*Share on Twitter function relays on OS X's Twitter integration.

Added "(Spotify)" suffix to some command in order to distinguish with iTunes command.

Thanks for Rob McBroom at Quicksilver Development Google group for all those suggestions.
