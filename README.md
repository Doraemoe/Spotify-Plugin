Spotify Quicksilver Plugin
==========================

Support 11 different commands to control Spotify, Shuffling and Repeat do not work as expect, reason unknown.

Commands include:

* Dcrease Volume (Spotify)

* Increase Volume (Spotify)

* Mute (Spotify)

* Next Song (Spotify)

* Previous Song (Spotify)

* Play (Spotify)

* Pause (Spotify)

* Play/Pause (Spotify)

* Share on Twitter (Spotify)*

*Share on Twitter function relays on OS X's Twitter integration.

Added "(Spotify)" suffix to some command in order to distinguish with iTunes command.

Thanks for Rob McBroom at Quicksilver Development Google group for all those suggestions.
